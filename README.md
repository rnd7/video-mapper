# Lux & Lucid VideoMapper
Simple single surface Video Projection Mapper realized as Electron App using THREE.js

## Installation
You need node and npm installed on your machine. It should work on all platforms electron supports. I only tested in on a linux machine.

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```

## Usage
The user interface is almost non existent... You can manipulate the scene using keyboard commands. Move point to check which is selected.

```
s: Save configuration
d: Load Defaults (Reset)
v: Toggle Vignette
t: Toggle Testpattern
PageUp: prev Point
PageDown: next Point
ArrowKeys: move Point
Shift + ArrowKeys: move Point faster
```
